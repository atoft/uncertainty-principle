== Half-Life 2: Uncertainty Principle ==

A mod for Half-Life 2: Episode Two. When the Combine raid your Resistance hideout, you are forced to flee into the depths of the Outlands. But with Overwatch forces hunting you down, and the local fauna out to get you, danger is always just around the corner. Play through four chapters of Half-Life gameplay, exploring new locations, meeting new characters and uncovering lost secrets.
